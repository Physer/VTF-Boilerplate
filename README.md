# VTF-Boilerplate

## Introduction
Welcome to the VTF Boilerplate project!
This project contains a predefined set of step defintions to get your automated regression tests up and running.

This project is complimenting the [Valtech Testing Framework]("https://github.com/Physer/Valtech-Testing-Framework"). It's recommended you run these two side by side!

## Installation
Simply install the NPM package, either globally or in your project folder by running:
```
npm install -g vtf-boilerplate
```

## Usage
Once your package is installed, you can call the boilerplate from the command line.

Navigate to your project and execute the following command:
```
vtf-boilerplate --destination *folderstructure*
```
